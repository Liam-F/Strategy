The biggest project I did in Natixis is in last October, we wanted to develop a new cross asset index to help us in the cross asset business. It took one month to develop this strategy but I do learn a lot from this process. 
At the beginning, I try to use the common standard methods such as minimum variance, equal weighted, momentum, rainbow, risk parity to test different etf universes. We are trying to include assets like Equity(SPY, QQQ), Bond(TLT, AGG), Credit(HYG, LQD), Real Estates(IYR, VNQ), Commodities(GLD, USO). But I found that no matter how I choose the universe, the performance of the strategy is not good enough to launch a new index.  It is kind of struggle. When I did some research about asset allocation method, I find something very interesting.  It is called maximum diversification. Its objective function is quite simple, It is just weighted average of std over variance of portfolio. If we have diversified portfolio, objective function will be very large. It is like open a new door for me. I start to test a lot of different objective function like sharpe ratio over variance. I think they will be helpful in the future. 


After I implement maximum diversification, we still notice that variance time horizon is kind of tricky. Too short is not convincing for client, but too long will not act fast with market. So I introduce the EWMA model to solve the problem.
